# The Chocofly keyboard

The Chocofly is an ergonomic monosplit keyboard with 4x6 column staggered keys,
4 thumb keys and 2 additional inner keys for the index finger (60 keys total) plus one rotary encoder.

The main idea of the Chocofly is to be [thin](https://imgur.com/a/kJ5HPdX) and suitable for "sonshi"-style usage (putting it [ontop the laptop keyboard](https://imgur.com/gallery/Bps65YA)). It is also pretty minimalistic - no LEDs/OLEDs/labels on keycaps/wires... and in my build it even has no case. It's just a pcb with switches on top of it and small silicone legs on the bottom. And this setup works pefectly! Well, for me at least.

Notable features:
- Kailh Choc V1 switches support (both hotswap and non-hotswap - in one PCB).
- Not very common 19x18mm switch spacing, which gives even gaps between the switches horizontally and vertically,
  but keeping the overal size similar to layouts with Cherry MX spacing.
- Non-agressive column stagger with just a little bit fan-angled 5th and 6th columns.
- Fancy-shmancy "flying" design.
