# The Chocofly keyboard

The Chocofly is an ergonomic keyboard with 4x6 column staggered keys,
4 thumb keys and 2 additional inner keys for the index finger (60 keys total) plus one encoder.
The main idea of the Chocofly is to be thin and suitable for "sonshi"-style usage (putting it ontop the laptop keyboard). It is also very minimalistic - no LEDs, OLEDs.

Some features:
- Kailh Choc switches support (both hotswap and non-hotswap in one PCB)
- Not very common 19x18mm switch spacing, which makes even gaps between the switches horizontally and vertically,
  but keeping the overal size similar to layouts based on Cherry MX.
- Non-agressive in general (almost Corne-like) column stagger with just a little bit of a "pinky stagger" for the 5th and 6th columns.
